      <h1>Traffic lights and twilights</h1>
      <p>Snapping back into reality after a 4 hour long binge watching fueled immersion forced me to pay particular attention to the lights (or the lack thereof) that were blurred by the mist forming on my window. I was back, and I needed to look beyond the 4 walls (6 surfaces, to include the ceiling and carpeted floor that contained crumbs of my leftover chips) and my window with its blinds open offered me exactly that: a view beyond.</p>
      <p>I looked at drastically different versions of the usually busy-with-traffic roads and as one does, I had thoughts. The emptiness of the roads initially came across as a surprise, and to soothe it, my subconscious created the urge to look at my left wrist. The hands of my digital watch made an L, (well, there goes my chance of waking up early) and my eyes returned to the mirror-esque roads that seemed to glow.</p>
      <p>The traffic signals caught my attention, with a car that moved once in a god-knows-when. Truth be told, it was eerie, the signals, well, signaling the non existent vehicles to stop, go and the non existent pedestrians to start crossing the road or counting down the time they had to get to the other side. The obsolescence of it worried me, with an urge to derive meaning from the emptiness. Not a forced attempt to be philosophical, but I wondered if my absence would strip away the meaning of those lights. Their purpose, momentarily, was solely dependent on the one person who was questioning it, and the burden felt isolating as well as powerful, although the intelligence of that one person is debatable for feeling the latter.</p>
      <p>Braincells being awake for longer than they are supposed can come up with ideas that other braincells (these ones have had sleep, just saying) will categorise this idea as downright cow poo. That said, I do think they deserve a bit of credit for being confident, having the openness to even consider the possibility that I can have power, which my (self declared) rational, well-rested brain cells can’t do on a daily basis. Well, maybe, sometimes, one does need those kinds of braincells, I shall emphasise that it’s not the lack of sleep I applaud them for, it’s the lack of inhibition.</p>
